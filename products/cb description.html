    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div style="margin: 15px 0 25px;">
      <p>TThe Reivitve Circulation Booster is a Class IIa medical device designed to increase leg circulation. It uses Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) to stimulate the muscles in your lower legs and feet to help counteract stasis and help maintain healthy legs. By placing your bare feet on each of the footpads, therapeutic electrical impulses stimulate the nerve endings on the soles of your feet. This causes the contraction and relaxation of muscles in the lower legs. This action is clinically tested & shown to increase circulation.
<br><br>
A typical session lasts 20-30 minutes. Use the device daily in order to feel the effects.</p>

          <div class='content'>
            <p>Blood flows around your body as part of the circulatory system. Our bodies were designed to be active and so when you walk your leg muscles actively contract and relax, to pump the blood up through the legs and back to the heart. Healthy leg circulation is where blood carries carbon dioxide and waste products pumped from your legs through your veins back to the heart and oxygenated blood is returned to the legs.<br><br>
Unfortunately if you are unable to take regular exercise and have a sedentary lifestyle, the leg muscle pumps are less active and blood flow is reduced. This can cause blood and fluid to pool in the legs and may cause swelling and discomfort otherwise referred to as 'Poor Circulation'.</p>

        <li>
          <h2><a href='#' class='head'>What does it feel like?</a></h2>
          <div class='content'>
            <p>After placing both bare feet on the footpads of the REVITIVE Circulation Booster, increase the intensity level for the feet (levels 1-99) until you feel strong, comfortable, non-painful muscle contraction. This feels like a gentle tingling, pins and needles sensation. You can control the intensity and duration with the easy-to-use remote control. Just 20 to 30-minutes per day is recommended to experience the benefits.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <h2><a href='#' class='head'>Drug free benefits</a></h2>
          <div class='content'>
            <p>The REVITIVE Circulation Booster was developed in the UK following the success of the original Circulation Booster. It is a drug-free and non-invasive solution to improve leg circulation. If you are sitting or standing for long periods, even just one 20-minute session using the REVITIVE Circulation Booster may help alleviate the symptoms associated with your legs being inactive.</p>
