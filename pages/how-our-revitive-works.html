<h1>Why is good circulation important?</h1>
<p>Great health and an active lifestyle require good circulation. Our body&rsquo;s cells depend on healthy circulation to deliver oxygenated blood and nutrients to feed them, and to remove deoxygenated blood and waste from our system. If you experience <a href="{{store url="health-information/poor-circulation/"}}">poor circulation </a>due to age, a sedentary life style, illness or a disability the symptoms can affect your wellbeing and prevent you from doing the things you love.</p>

<h2>Healthy leg circulation &ndash; your second heart</h2>
<p>Your leg muscles are what we call the &lsquo;second heart&rsquo; and they work a clever but simple system to help pump blood around the body. Working against gravity, your leg muscles continually push blood through one way valves in the veins up through your feet and legs and back to the heart.</p>
<h2>How does REVITIVE work?</h2>
<p>REVITIVE activates your second heart by applying<!--  proven --> Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) to the soles of your feet through two large foot pads. This EMS makes the foot and calf muscles contract and relax to create a pumping action. Consequently the blood immediately moves through the veins in your legs and back to your heart</p>
<h2>What does it feel like?</h2>
<p>You will feel mild impulses in your feet and calf muscles when you first turn the Revitive Circulation Booster. Increase the intensity until your calf muscles gently contract and relax at a comfortable level. You can control the intensity and duration with the easy-to-use remote control. Simply sit back and relax while the soothing impulses refresh and revitalise your feet and lower legs.</p>
<h2>Drug free benefits</h2>
<p>The Revitive Circulation Booster has helped thousands of people increase their circulation, reduce swelling and sooth achy, heavy legs. Research by London South Bank University in the UK has shown that 40 minutes of inactivity in healthy people, resulted in poorer circulation and swelling in the lower legs and feet. After only 10 minutes of using the Revitive Circulation Booster, all symptoms were significantly improved.</p>
<h2>What results can you expect?</h2>
<p>REVITIVE has been developed and tested by researchers at leading UK universities. <!-- It is the only device of its kind proven to: --></p>
